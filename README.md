# Lucas Petherbridge :: Developer. Technology Enthusiast.

My name is Lucas Petherbridge. I'm a programmer and technology enthusiast. I also love to code.

This project is a website portfolio of projects and articles where I write about things that intrigue and inspire my work in the software industry. Excellence in everything is rare and it is my hope that this site might inspire others to excellence.
